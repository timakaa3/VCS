Library Directory
This directory (lib) is reserved for:

Shared Libraries: Custom code (headers .h and source .cpp) shared across multiple projects (e.g., a custom protocol handler or sensor driver used in both Lab 1 and Lab 2).
Third-Party Libraries: Libraries that are not available via the Arduino Library Manager or that you want to bundle with your project to ensure compatibility.
Project-Specific Headers: Configuration headers (like pin_config.h or settings.h) if they are reused.
Current Status
This folder is currently empty because  existing project rely on standard Arduino libraries (installed globally via IDE) or self-contained logic within the .ino files.
